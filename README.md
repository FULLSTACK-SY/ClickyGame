# ClickyGame

* The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

* The application keeps track of the user's score.

* The user's score increments with image click.

* The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
